                    <li>A bottleneck was identified in the profile picture, as it is a requiered field, and several users drop out at this point.</li>

            <div  class="comment06 comment">It was incredible to achieve a participation of 143 users. This was helpful as the Stakeholders were concerned about the step-by-step approach, as they felt it might be too long for the user. </div>
