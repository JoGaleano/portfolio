        <div class="intro">
            <p>Well, let me tell you a little about me. <span>I really love making products that make life a bit easier and more enjoyable for people, you know?</span> Being human is complex enough, right? </p>
            <p>My journey began in UX/UI Design, but I kinda found my true calling joining together Product Design with Data Science. For this reason, I currently be a Bachellor's Degree Student of Data Science in CAECE University.</p>
            <p>Since 2022, I have been professionally engaged in digital product design, <span>gaining valuable experience in the creation of mobile applications, SaaS platforms, and B2B system software</span>. This background has given me a thorough immersion in the fundamentals of digital design.</p>

            <h2>A Glimpse into My Journey</h2>
            <p><span>I hail from Paraguay and currently reside in Argentina.</span> My adventure began at 17 when I embarked on a life-altering cultural exchange program in Germany. This experience was more than just a change of scenery from my small hometown of 30,000 people; it was a gateway to a world of diverse cultures, languages, and cities. Embracing these new experiences solo wasn't just a journey across continents; it was a journey within, fostering significant personal growth.</p>
            <p>Living amidst such diversity, <span>I learned to view challenges as catalysts for growth</span>, both for myself and the communities I engage with. This mindset has been a guiding force in my professional life, where I constantly seek to turn obstacles into opportunities for innovation and positive change. I'm excited to bring this perspective to your team, contributing not just my skills, but also a global and growth-oriented mindset.</p>

        <div class="moodboard">
            <h2>Moodboards</h2>
            <p>I'm a firm believer in the power of moodboards as tools for self-discovery and understanding others. With that in mind, I'm excited to share my personal moodboard, which has been instrumental in shaping my portfolio and defining my aspirations for 2024. <span>This moodboard is more than just a collection of images and ideas; it's a reflection of my professional journey, creative inspirations, and the goals that propel me forward</span>. I hope it offers you a glimpse into who I am, not just as a professional but as an individual continuously striving for growth and innovation.</p>
