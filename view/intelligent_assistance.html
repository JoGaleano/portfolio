                    <p>As a first step, <span> I recognised the need to delve deeper into conversational design</span>, a new field for me. To bridge this knowledge gap, I enrolled in and completed two specialised masterclasses offered by the Interaction Design Foundation.</p>

                <div class="market_share">
                    <h3>Market research</h3>
                    <p>At this point given that the focus of the company is B2B, and that the product we offer is unique in many ways. Our market research focus was primarily on providing an experience in interacting with the chat and the safety of interacting with it. </p>
                    <p>Given that we are in a time where AI is embedded in our daily lives, we had the challenge of identifying the user's mental map of AI. Identify what the first launch should have as a minimum so as not to frustrate the user. We had to be extremely careful with the fact that we were working with sensitive data, we had to build trust in the user that their data was not shared and also identify the technology limitations and biases that might exist in the team. </p>
                    <p>For my part, I focused on identifying the key questions we needed to answer for this proposal: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How would we respond if we didn't have the answer?</li>
                            <li>How would we limit ambiguity?</li>
                            <li>How would we define the scope of our responses in the first launch?</li>
                            <li>What would be the main risks for the company?</li>
                            <li>What would be the tone and voice in which we would speak to the user?</li>
                            <li> How would we measure the success and/or failure of the interactions?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For these answers I worked together with Customer Success, Marketing, Sales and Engineering to align the business objectives with the experience we wanted to provide to the user, so that it would be the same at any point of interaction with the company.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="definitions">
                    <h3>Definitions</h3>
                    <p>After several meetings with the Data & Engineering team, we defined 3 stages of evolution for the chat. I will focus on the first stage:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>1. That the model can answer frequently asked questions about the use of the platform. </li>
                        <li>2. The model can also answer questions about specific rules or configurations made on the platform.</li>
                        <li>3. That the model can provide dynamic explanations of the metrics and data observed on the platform.</li>
                        <li>4. Archive conversations and be able to continue with them if necessary.</li>
                        <li>5. Give initial prompts as a sample of what you can ask the chat, in order to guide the user in the scope of the questions.</li>
                        <li>6. This chat functionality will be cross-platform.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                
                <div class="design">
                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>While I can't share the final design, I want to highlight an important trend in visual design that is observed in AI software releases, and that is the use of the following visual variants. This trend helps the user associate that these are AI tools. </p>
                    <img src="../assets/design_IA.png" alt="Design images">
                    <p>One of the objectives for our platform is that through the design the user understands that it is not a simple chat bot, but making it clear that it was not a conversation with a human being so as not to generate frustration in case of not getting specific answers to their questions. </p>
                    <p>The challenge in the design was that this functionality has three stages, so the scalability of the design must be considered.</p>

            <div  class="comment8 comment"><span>The point 3</span> generated an interesting debate in the team. To improve the experience, I proposed that this dynamic explanation be made for each section and/or metric.  That is to say, to achieve that the user with a click can have an explanation of the data, in addition to providing findings and recommendations through the models managed by the Data Science team. Without having to navigate in the chat to get to this information.The team was open to this proposal and was able to implement this functionality.</div>
