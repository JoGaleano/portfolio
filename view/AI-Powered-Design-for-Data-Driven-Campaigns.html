                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>For this project,<span> I worked with a leading fintech client in Mexico to design a data-driven social media content calendar aimed at promoting select businesses where their cardholders frequently transacted</span>. The campaign combined AI-generated visuals with insights drawn from transaction data, creating targeted content that resonated with users on social media and within the banking app. The focus was on increasing user engagement through timely, relevant promotions based on user behavior.</p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The fintech client aimed to boost user engagement and encourage spending at specific partner businesses. The key objectives were to identify which merchants within the agreement were most frequented by cardholders, determine the best days to publish content based on transaction data, and create visually appealing content that was optimized for both social media and the app while aligning with the financial technology company’s brand identity.</p>
                <p>To achieve this, <span>I needed to create a campaign that would be both strategically timed and visually compelling</span>, leveraging AI-generated visuals for efficiency and consistency.</p>

As the project lead on my side, <span>I collaborated extensively with our commercial team and data team to ensure the campaign's success</span>.

                    <p>The fintech client wanted to boost customer engagement and encourage spending at specific partner businesses. The key objectives were to:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, the data showed that Fridays were the days with the highest transaction volume at entertainment venues, while Mondays were the most popular at grocery stores. <span>This helped determine the optimal publishing schedule</span>, ensuring that the content was relevant and appealed to users.</p>

                    <p>To create attractive images quickly and efficiently, <a href="https://firefly.adobe.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;">I used adobe's AI-based tools to generate the 3D images</a> for the social media posts and app banners. Each image was tailored to the type of business being promoted, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3D go-karts were created to represent the experience of a leisure venue.</li>
                        <li>Dynamic images of shops were designed to promote commercial offers.</li>
                        <li>Shop characters to accompany the brand.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Generative artificial intelligence enabled rapid iterations of these visual elements, ensuring that the content was engaging, visually consistent and adaptable to different platforms (social media and in-app displays).</p>

                    <p>While generative AI enables faster and more efficient asset creation, it still has limitations, particularly in accurately applying specific colors and brand elements. To ensure the visuals met the required standards, I used Photoshop, Lightroom, and Adobe Illustrator for final refinements and adjustments.

            <div class="comment2 comment">This project was a new challenge for me, as I had to quickly learn and apply marketing strategies to ensure success. The campaign required not only the creation of a social media content calendar, but also a coordinated approach that included posts, stories, push notifications, and in-app banners. I needed to integrate these elements seamlessly while ensuring that the campaign was data-driven, visually engaging, and aligned with the fintech’s growth goals.</div>

            <div class="comment3 comment">Collaboration with the fintech team was facilitated through tools like Figma and Illustrator for collaborative design, Slack for constant communication, and Google Sheets for data management and tracking.</div>

            <div  class="comment4 comment">In addition to focusing on high-transaction merchants, the commercial team required us to include specific partner brands in the campaign. By analyzing the data, we identified the optimal days to feature these new brands, ensuring they were introduced to cardholders at times when engagement would be highest, even if they weren’t among the top transaction venues.</div>

            <div  class="comment5 comment">It is important to note that the calendar is subject to change during the month due to events, new partnerships or the bank's needs. </div>

            <div  class="comment6 comment">I reduce the image to the concept of working methodology to provide a better understanding of the process. </div>

            <div  class="comment7 comment">Use Adobe Firefly as it has been trained with licensed, Adobe-owned, or public domain images, which ensures that the generated images comply with copyrights and licenses, avoiding legal issues. In addition, brand manuals from retailers and banks are available to ensure the correct creation of visual assets.</div>

            <div  class="comment8 comment">This part of the job is the most time-consuming, but it also allows me to connect with design.</div>
